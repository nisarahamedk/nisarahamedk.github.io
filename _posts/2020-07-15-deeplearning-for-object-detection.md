# Deep Learning Evolution in Object Detection - From Fast RCNN to DETR

Deep learning has been very successful in computer vision. Ever since the alexnet moment in 2013, There has been a significant uproar of deep learning approaches for solving various computer vision problems. Ranging from simple image classification to video understanding. Although problems like image classification was rather straight forward to solve using neural networks, as the task at hand got more complex, lot of hand engineered heuristics needed to get the end to end system working properly. One such problem domain is Object detection. However, recently there was a major shift in this area by the ntroduction of Transformers. In this post we will look at different approaches for Object Detection using neural networks and see how they have evolved over time.

## RCNN - Region Based CNN

## Fast RCNN

## Faster RCNN

## YOLO

## DETR
